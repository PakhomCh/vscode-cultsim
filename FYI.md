# FYI

This is first iteration code, so I am completly aware that it needs consistency and optimization (and lots and lots of tests)

However, since this project is single handly developed by myself I can't provide a timeline, but if you feel like helping out: discuss, fork and provide a pull request and then together we can make this the extension great.

I will probably provide a talk over youtube which might aid futher development so you don't have to start from square one with the learning process.
