    "description": "Decks are collections of nouns. A simple, shuffled list, with extras. They are a list of shuffled non-aspect elements (cards) that can be drawn by recipes during their execution. They can be reshuffled on exhaustion, or not.\n\n`Deck` can refer to the deck state (a list of cards in a set order and a list of forbidden cards, which is stored in the game’s save files and does not persist across playthroughs), or the deck object (which is all the data about every instance of a given deck, regardless of what part of which game it may be from… unless the object is changed after the state is made). This distinction is important when decks are modified mid-game: the deck object is changed, but the deck state is not. Cards that might have been removed from the deck object may still be in the deck state, and cards added to the deck object will not be added to the deck state.\n\nDeck states keep track of unique cards (either cards where unique = true, or where ‘uniquenessgroup’ is set) that already exist: when a unique card is generated anywhere in the game, it, and all elements that share a uniqueness group with it, are added to a forbidden list on all decks that contain that element or group. If a card is in a deck state’s forbidden list, it is removed from the deck’s draw list, and will never be shuffled back into the draw list for the rest of the game. This way, duplicate unique cards are not drawn from decks."
